If you're easily offended, please do not install this mod.

[/r/ShitRimworldSays](https://reddit.com/r/ShitRimworldSays) is a collection of the funniest (and often most gruesome) Rimworld quotes, _taken out of context_. I have absolutely no control over what quotes actually end up on the reddit, or get shown to you.

![Known Issues](https://banners.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Known%20Issues.png)

Some quotes make no sense (often posts with images), and some are way too big for the available space. Not much I can do about it, sorry!
