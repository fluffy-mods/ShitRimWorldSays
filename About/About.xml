  <description>adds quotes from /r/ShitRimWorldSays to RimWorld loading screens

&lt;size=24&gt;Important&lt;/size&gt;
If you’re easily offended, please do not install this mod.

/r/ShitRimworldSays is a collection of the funniest (and often most gruesome) Rimworld quotes, &lt;i&gt;taken out of context&lt;/i&gt;. I have absolutely no control over what quotes actually end up on the reddit, or get shown to you.

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
Automatically downloads the latest and greatest quotes from /r/ShitRimworldSays, and displays them on loading screens.

Includes an option to disable the gameplay tips that are usually shown.

For example;

&lt;size=24&gt;Known Issues&lt;/size&gt;
Some quotes make no sense (often posts with images), and some are way too big for the available space. Not much I can do about it, sorry!

&lt;size=24&gt;Version&lt;/size&gt;
This is version 2.2.25, for RimWorld 1.1.2652.
