    <description>adds quotes from /r/ShitRimWorldSays to RimWorld loading screens

&lt;size=28&gt;Important&lt;/size&gt;

If you're easily offended, please do not install this mod.

&lt;b&gt;/r/ShitRimworldSays&lt;/b&gt; is a collection of the funniest (and often most gruesome) Rimworld quotes, &lt;i&gt;taken out of context&lt;/i&gt;. I have absolutely no control over what quotes actually end up on the reddit, or get shown to you.

&lt;size=28&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;

Automatically downloads the latest and greatest quotes from &lt;b&gt;/r/ShitRimworldSays&lt;/b&gt;, and displays them on loading screens.

Includes an option to disable the gameplay tips that are usually shown.

For example;

&lt;size=28&gt;Known Issues&lt;/size&gt;

Some quotes make no sense (often posts with images), and some are way too big for the available space. Not much I can do about it, sorry!</description>
